# TSVF-SUSY: A Time-Symmetric and CPT-Invariant Supersymmetric Framework for Quantum Gravity and Cosmological Phenomena

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains the research paper, LaTeX source, and simulation data for **TSVF-SUSY**, a **Time-Symmetric and CPT-Invariant Supersymmetric Framework for Quantum Gravity and Cosmological Phenomena**. This model unifies the **Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF)** with **\(\mathcal{N}=1\)** Supersymmetry (SUSY) to construct a mathematically rigorous, renormalizable, and testable alternative to conventional quantum gravity approaches.

TSVF-SUSY is built from first principles using a **CPT-invariant path integral**, a **fully local ghost-free Lagrangian**, and **bidirectional boundary conditions**, providing a retrocausal mechanism for time evolution consistent with observed physics.

---

## 🧠 Key Contributions

- ✅ **Ghost-free, local Lagrangian** incorporating retrocausal time symmetry  
- ✅ **One-loop renormalizability** and UV completeness via asymptotic safety (Functional RG flow)  
- ✅ **SUSY algebra closure** preserved under Planck-scale curvature corrections  
- ✅ **Cosmological constant suppression** through auxiliary field cancellation + CPT symmetry  
- ✅ **Second-quantized graviton field** and TSVF-induced boundary dynamics  

---

## 🔬 Testable Predictions

- 📡 **Gravitational wave phase shifts and echoes**, testable by LIGO/Virgo and Einstein Telescope  
- 🧊 **Neutrino oscillation anomalies** (\(\theta_{23}\) shifts), observable in DUNE and JUNO  
- ⚛️ **Collider-scale SUSY signatures**, including gluino production thresholds at FCC-hh  

---

## 💻 Numerical Simulations

Complementary simulations included in this repo (see `/simulations`) support:

- ✅ Modified RG running with retrocausal boundary terms  
- ✅ Gravitational wave echo spectrograms under TSVF-SUSY  
- ✅ Neutrino phase interference and PMNS matrix corrections  
- ✅ Retarded-advanced interference effects via weak measurement analogs

Simulation outputs align with published figures and are reproducible using the provided Python notebooks.
